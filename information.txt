intent object- An object that represents the user's request. e.g., Their intent to ask for a quote of the day.
  * There are built in default intents such as e.g., stop, help, etc.

  Each intent has two properties:
  - The intent property gives the name of the intent.
  - The slots property lists the slots associated with that intent.

response object- This object provides a way for Alexa to send information back to the user. e.g., What to "tell" the user or "ask" the user.
  * The two key differences between "tell and ask"
   1) the session is kept open, waiting for a further response from the user.
   2) the second argument is a string that Alexa will speak to the user if they havenâ€™t responded to specify what they want.



slots - Is a way for the user to provide variable input. e.g., tell me a fact about "____"
  * There are built in Amazon slots such as AMAZON.DATE, AMAZON.US_CITY
  * Slots are arguments to intents.
  * A custom slot type consists of a name and a line-separated list of values.


Utterance - Each possible sample utterance is assigned to one of the defined intents.

"what will the horoscope for {Sign} be on {Date}"
In this utterance, the slots {Sign} and {Date} serve as arguments to the GetHoroscope intent, and are placed as variables in this utterance pattern.

  session object- This contains information about the dialog/conversation between the user and Alexa.

  SSML- Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)
  SSML is a markup language that provides a standard way to mark up text for the generation of synthetic speech.
  For example, you may want a longer pause within the speech, or you may want a string of digits read back as a standard telephone number.

  When the OnLaunch Event is triggered, a response object return four methods which are "tell", "tellWithCard", "ask", "askWithCard"
  i.e response.ask(speechOutput, repromptOutput);

  intentHandlers have different intent objects in which each is a function of the request i.e function handleNewFactRequest(intent, response)
